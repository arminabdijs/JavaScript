and interact with page elements.

Full explanation : 
The DOM (Document Object Model) is a tree-structured, object-based representation of a web page that the browser creates after parsing the HTML.
In this model, every part of the page such as elements, text, and attributes is represented as a node.

Through the DOM, JavaScript can:

Access HTML elements

Change content, styles, and attributes

Create, update, or remove elements

Respond to events like clicks and user input

In simple terms, the DOM is the bridge between HTML and JavaScript, and without it, a web page would be static and non-interactive.
